This script when compiled and executed outputs the text "Hello World!" on the
CLI (also demonstrates how to use benchmarkingTime.h)

Note, the version, author, date, and a brief description of the scripts
functionality as a comment at the top of your files is highly recommended

Also, check out Clang-Format, Prettier, or a similar formatting tool in order to
make tidying up your scripts much easier when working on large projects or group
projects
